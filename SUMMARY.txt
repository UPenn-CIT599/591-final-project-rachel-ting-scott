Project name:
News Article Recommender

Description:
This program takes a user's input of a URL of a news article page and scrapes that page in order to return the text as a clean string.
Then, it runs an analysis on the linguistic content of that text. It tokenizes the content (splits the string into individual tokens, 
or words) and removes the stop words from that list of tokens. In a lot of NLP analysis, stop words get in the way, cause irregularities, 
and can also slow down the program. Next, the program takes the tokens and runs the sentiment analysis on them to get the positivity score 
of the user's article. Then it takes the tokens and tags them for their parts of speech (POS) in order to get the lemma. Lemma are the 
base form of words in a dictionary. This is done so that words with the same dictionary root are considered the same for the purpose of 
semantic analysis. So, the lemma form of 'says' is 'say' and the lemma form of 'classes' is 'class'. Extracting the lemma then results 
in more accurate frequency calculations of words for semantic analysis. This lemmanization results in the finding of the top n (hard-coded to 5) 
content words of an article which is a rudimentary strategy for finding keywords. The analysis then finds the names of people mentioned in 
the article and returns the top n (hard-coded to 3) most frequently found. After that, the top content words (keywords) are used to check 
against a data set of NYTimes articles that are tagged by keyword to suggest to the user articles from that data set that include one or 
more of the same keywords. The analysis and recommendations are output to the user via the GUI.
